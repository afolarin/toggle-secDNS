To create a Chrome extension for a Secure DNS toggle button, you will need to:

manifest.json
contentscript.js
popup.html
popup.css

Once you have created the extension files, zip them up into a single file.

Open Chrome and go to chrome://extensions/.

Enable Developer mode by toggling the switch in the top right corner.

Click the "Load unpacked" button and select the ZIP file for your extension.

Your extension should now be installed and enabled.

To use the extension, click the Secure DNS Toggle Button icon in the Chrome toolbar. This will open a popup window where you can toggle the Secure DNS setting.

Note: This is a basic example of a Secure DNS toggle button extension. You can customize it to add additional features, such as the ability to select a custom DNS provider.
